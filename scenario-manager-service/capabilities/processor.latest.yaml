  # HTTP processor configuration model:
  # - mode:
  #     - THREAD_COUNT: cap concurrency per instance to `threadCount` in-flight HTTP calls.
  #       The Rabbit worker adapter uses a bounded executor with no backlog so messages
  #       stay queued in Rabbit when all threads are busy.
  #     - RATE_PER_SEC: pace calls to approximately `ratePerSec` HTTP requests per second
  #       across the instance, still honouring `threadCount` as a hard max-in-flight cap.
  #       Pacing delay is not counted in the reported call latency.
  # - threadCount: desired concurrent HTTP calls per worker instance. When there is enough
  #   work available, the processor will maintain up to this many in-flight requests.
  # - ratePerSec: target HTTP calls per second in RATE_PER_SEC mode. The worker spaces calls
  #   using a shared token bucket so bursts are smoothed over time.
  # - keepAlive + connectionReuse:
  #     - keepAlive=true, connectionReuse=GLOBAL:
  #         - Shared Apache HttpClient connection pool with up to 200 total / 200 per route
  #           connections (also exposed as httpMaxConnections in runtime status).
  #     - keepAlive=true, connectionReuse=PER_THREAD:
  #         - One keep-alive HttpClient per worker thread, so effective max connections is
  #           ~threadCount.
  #     - keepAlive=false or connectionReuse=NONE:
  #         - No keep-alive; each HTTP call uses a fresh connection and closes it afterwards.
  # - Observability:
  #     - Each call records:
  #         - x-ph-processor-duration-ms: time spent in the HTTP call itself (no pacing delay).
  #         - x-ph-processor-connection-latency-ms: time spent waiting for RATE_PER_SEC pacing.
  #     - Runtime status includes:
  #         - httpMode, httpThreadCount, httpMaxConnections, transactions, successRatio,
  #           avgLatencyMs (average HTTP call latency).
