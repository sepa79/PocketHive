# In‑Progress Plans

This directory groups **active architectural and SDK plans** that are
currently being implemented or iterated on. Some live directly under
`docs/inProgress`, others sit alongside the relevant code (for example
under `docs/sdk`, `docs/control-plane`, or `docs/architecture`). This
index is a convenience for humans and tools.

Notable in‑progress plans:

Files in this folder should carry a `Status: in progress` header so it’s clear
they are live design documents rather than historical notes.
