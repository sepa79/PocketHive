# Future / TODO Plans

This directory groups **future design plans** that have not yet been
implemented. They act as a backlog of larger architectural changes.

Notable “todo” plans:

- `docs/sdk/control-plane-io-plan.md` – IO v2 where the control plane owns IO config.
- `docs/sdk/http-request-processor-plan.md` – richer HTTP processor worker and response routing.
- `docs/sdk/worker-plugin-plan.md` – plugin-based workers.
- `docs/sdk/workitem-refactor-plan.md` – WorkItem + interceptor pipeline follow-ups.
- `docs/build-id-plan.md` – build id / runtime version propagation.

Each plan file has a `Status: future / design` header to distinguish it
from implemented work.
