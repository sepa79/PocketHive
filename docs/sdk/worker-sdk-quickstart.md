# PocketHive Worker SDK Quick Start

This guide shows how to adopt the simplified Worker SDK introduced in the Stage 1â€“3 refactor. Pair it with the
[Stage 0 design](worker-sdk-stage0-design.md) and [Stage 1 runtime walkthrough](worker-sdk-stage1-runtime.md) when you need
deeper architectural context.

## 1. Add the dependency and starter

Include the Worker SDK starter in your Spring Boot service. The starter composes the control-plane auto-configuration,
registers the Stage 1 `WorkerRuntime`, and wires the `WorkerControlPlaneRuntime` that powers Stage 2 status/config
synchronisation.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pockethive</groupId>
  <artifactId>worker-sdk</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Configure the control-plane identity and role using the shared properties:

```yaml
pockethive:
  control-plane:
    exchange: ph.control
    swarm-id: swarm-1
    worker:
      role: processor
      instance-id: processor-1
```

See the [control-plane worker guide](../control-plane/worker-guide.md) for full property reference.

## 2. Annotate worker beans

Annotate each business implementation with `@PocketHiveWorker`. Choose the worker type (`GENERATOR` or `MESSAGE`) and
provide routing metadata. Optional `config` classes participate in Stage 2 control-plane hydration.

```java
@Component("processorWorker")
@PocketHiveWorker(
    role = "processor",
    type = WorkerType.MESSAGE,
    inQueue = TopologyDefaults.MOD_QUEUE,
    outQueue = TopologyDefaults.FINAL_QUEUE,
    config = ProcessorWorkerConfig.class
)
class ProcessorWorkerImpl implements MessageWorker {
  // business logic
}
```

Generator workers follow the same pattern but implement `GeneratorWorker` and omit `inQueue`.

## 3. Implement the worker interfaces

The Stage 1 runtime discovers annotated beans and invokes the corresponding business interface:

- `GeneratorWorker.generate(WorkerContext)` emits a single `WorkMessage` per invocation. Stage 2 control-plane updates
  determine how often `GeneratorRuntimeAdapter` schedules the call.
- `MessageWorker.onMessage(WorkMessage, WorkerContext)` receives inbound messages converted by the SDK transport and
  returns a `WorkResult` to publish downstream.

Use the `WorkerContext` to:

- Retrieve typed configuration supplied by Stage 2 control-plane commands (`context.config(MyConfig.class)`).
- Enrich Stage 2 status payloads via `context.statusPublisher()`.
- Access Stage 3 observability hooks (`observationRegistry`, `observabilityContext`). The runtime guarantees that
  `observabilityContext()` returns an initialised instance so workers can append hops without null checks.

Refer to the migrated [generator](../../generator-service/src/main/java/io/pockethive/generator/GeneratorWorkerImpl.java)
and [processor](../../processor-service/src/main/java/io/pockethive/processor/ProcessorWorkerImpl.java) services for
end-to-end implementations.

## 4. Dispatch work through the runtime adapters

Transport adapters inject the Stage 1 `WorkerRuntime` and Stage 2 `WorkerControlPlaneRuntime` beans. The existing
services provide reference implementations:

- [`GeneratorRuntimeAdapter`](../../generator-service/src/main/java/io/pockethive/generator/GeneratorRuntimeAdapter.java)
  drives scheduled invocations and publishes results.
- [`TriggerRuntimeAdapter`](../../trigger-service/src/main/java/io/pockethive/trigger/TriggerRuntimeAdapter.java) shows
  how to fan-in RabbitMQ deliveries before calling `workerRuntime.dispatch(...)`.
- [`ProcessorRuntimeAdapter`](../../processor-service/src/main/java/io/pockethive/processor/ProcessorRuntimeAdapter.java)
  demonstrates how to register control-plane listeners to apply per-worker configuration.

These adapters call `WorkerControlPlaneRuntime.handle(...)` for inbound control-plane messages and subscribe to
`WorkerStateSnapshot` updates to hydrate in-memory defaults.

## 5. Test with the SDK fixtures

Stage 1 introduced `ControlPlaneTestFixtures` and `WorkerSdkTestFixtures` to make unit tests deterministic. Use them to
construct canonical identities, topology descriptors, and sample payloads without repeating boilerplate.

```java
ControlPlaneProperties props = ControlPlaneTestFixtures.workerProperties("swarm-1", "processor", "processor-1");
WorkerRuntime runtime = WorkerSdkTestFixtures.runtime(applicationContext);
```

## 6. Observability and Stage 3 enhancements

Stage 3 enriches the runtime with Micrometer and Observation support. `WorkerContext.meterRegistry()` and
`WorkerContext.observationRegistry()` surface the shared registries, while `WorkMessage` builders accept an
`ObservabilityContext`. The SDK ensures that `WorkerContext.observabilityContext()` never returns {@code null} and
includes a trace id, hop list, and swarm id, making it safe to append hop metadata or forward the context as-is.
Use these hooks to emit custom metrics and propagate trace metadata as shown in the
[processor worker](../../processor-service/src/main/java/io/pockethive/processor/ProcessorWorkerImpl.java).

For the full roadmap and design rationale, review the [Worker SDK simplification plan](worker-sdk-simplification-plan.md).
