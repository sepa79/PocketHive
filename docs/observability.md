## Buzz Panel

The Buzz panel aggregates REST and STOMP activity from both the Hive services and the UI.

1. Open the **Buzz** view in the UI header.
2. Use the **Source** and **Channel** dropdowns to filter entries.
3. Adjust the **Limit** field to control how many recent messages are retained.

Each entry displays its timestamp, origin, channel and payload to help operators trace system interactions.
